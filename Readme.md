Hello! :slightly_smiling_face:

This repository is dedicated to participate in the Javascript 30 Days Challenge.

It is a way to learn on a daily basis, so I can continually challenge myself.

I'd be updating this read.me, trying to read what I've learned on each lesson.

## LOGS

### DAY 1

-   I've learned about key event, new tag like kbd, how to link the audio and information about data-key, more about HTML DOM and how to use css classes in the classList.
